Nikon Z8 Custom Setup and Field Guide‚ÄìMy Approach
Mar 16
üìå Firmware 3.0 Note (July 2025)
This guide was written initially for Firmware Version 2.0. With the release of Z8 Firmware 3.0, several menu items have been renumbered or moved, especially within the Custom Settings Menu. If you‚Äôre following my Nikon menu navigation numbers, please note that they may differ under v3.0.

Firmware 3.0 also introduces major new features, such as Subject Detection in Manual Focus and a Focus Limiter Setting, which I‚Äôll be testing in the field over the coming weeks. A fully updated version of this setup guide is currently in development.

In the meantime, you can read my first impressions of the firmware update here:

üëâ Nikon Z8 Firmware 3.0 for Wildlife Photographers

I‚Äôm planning a photo shoot tomorrow morning, so I‚Äôm reviewing how I set up my Nikon Z8s. The settings are largely the same on the Nikon Z9, but this post is not for users of other cameras. Sorry.

‚ÄúWant to put your Z8 to the test in the field? Join me in Louisiana for hands-on bird and landscape photo tours‚Äîperfect for mastering your camera and capturing unforgettable images.‚Äù

A quick heads-up ‚Äî I‚Äôve replaced the original Nikon Z8 Quick Settings PDF with an improved version and also updated this page itself with the same changes.

The settings themselves haven‚Äôt changed (I‚Äôm still using the same setup that‚Äôs worked well since v2.1), but‚Ä¶Some of the original Nikon menu references were off (a few wrong letter/number combos)

The new version is cleaner, easier to follow, and better formatted for printing or saving to your phone.

This guide will walk you through setting up your Nikon Z8 to maximize efficiency with back button focus, playback customization, AF modes on the record button, ISO on the lens control ring, subject detection toggle on the Fn2 button, and exposure delay mode on the playback button. I‚Äôve also included a field guide for those using these settings. When away from the camera for some time, I forget what I‚Äôve set, so I created this guide to ensure things are set correctly. After feeding it a list of functions I have been using on the camera, I've used ChatGPT to write this.  I‚Äôve added a downloadable quick reference as well as detailed information.

If you‚Äôre looking for a complete reference‚Äîincluding every setting in the Custom Settings Menu with my actual in-camera values‚ÄîI‚Äôve created a downloadable PDF you can keep on your phone or print for field use.

This pairs well with the Quick Settings Guide below, especially if you want to see all my settings across the entire Z8 menu.
