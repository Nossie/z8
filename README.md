## 🐶 Dog Portrait Preset (Black Background)

### Key Settings
- **Mode:** Manual (M)

- **AF Mode:** AF-S + Animal Eye Detection
- **Metering:** Spot
- **Lighting:** Single flash/softbox aimed only at the dog

### Shooting Tips
1. **Kill the ambient light** – Underexpose background by 2–3 stops.
2. **Use a flash or softbox** – Aim only at the dog, keep background unlit.
3. **Distance** – Place the dog 1–2 m in front of the background.

## 🐴 Horse Photography Preset (Action & Portrait)

**Goal:** Freeze motion during gallops or jumps while also handling static portraits.

### Key Settings
- **Mode:** Shutter Priority (S)
- **Shutter:** 1/1000–1/2000 s
- **ISO:** Auto ISO ON (64–3200)
- **AF Mode:** AF-C + 3D Tracking + Animal Eye Detection
- **Drive:** Continuous High (C15/C30)
- **Pre-release Capture:** ON (0.3–1 s)

### Shooting Tips
1. **Fast shutter** – 1/1000 s minimum, faster for full gallop.
2. **Tracking** – Use 3D Tracking to follow horse eyes.
3. **Positioning** – Low angles & side light emphasize muscle and shape.
4. **Burst intelligently** – Use short bursts to avoid filling the buffer.
5. **Anticipate movement** – Pre-release capture helps with unpredictable starts.
